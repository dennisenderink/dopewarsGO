# dopewarsGO
Game where you travel, buy and sell dope for profit. Matchup of an old '84 text based game and AR goodness.

## The idea
Take an old but highly addictive game as drug wars and create a modern version with multiplayer features and geolocation driven choices.
The game should stay close to the original as much as it can but fix existing problems and add promising features without damaging the original.

## Latest "stable" version
